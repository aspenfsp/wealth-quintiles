# Analysis of Households by Wealth Quintile Using Data from the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances

This repository includes code written in R that analyzes data from the 1989, 2007, and 2019 waves of the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) regarding net worth, assets, and debts by net worth quintiles. This analysis was used to inform a report from the Aspen Institute, 100+ Solutions to Build Wealth from the Bottom Up: Pathways to a Future of Shared Prosperity.

SCF data was downloaded from the Federal Reserve's website: https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm/.

The main estimates are contained in a presentable format in the file, "scf_quintiles_script.md". For the script that generated this file, see "scf_quintiles_script.rmd".
